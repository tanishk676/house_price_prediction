This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various property features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors. The goal is to analyze real-estate data, identify key price-driving features, and develop an accurate and reliable regression model.

📌 Project Overview

Accurately estimating house prices is a critical task in the real-estate industry. In this project, we implement an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Multiple regression techniques are explored to determine the best-performing model.
